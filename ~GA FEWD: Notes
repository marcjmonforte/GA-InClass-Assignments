GA FEWD: Notes

---

[WEEK 1]

/ AJAX is dated, dont use it - we use JSON now (Javascript Object Notation).
/// The X in AJAX is XML, we don't use that anymore.
/ Jon Duckett - HTML & CSS, Javascript & jQuery (recommended book for reference)
/ Typically .png is used over a .gif or a .jpeg
/// .jpeg does not allow transparency
/ CLASSES are used repeatedly throughout the course, but IDs are only used once.
/ DOM is like a family tree, with parents and children
/// Parent tag --> child tag; what's the child tag of the lowest level tag? The content.
/ HOMEWORK is on Github: Week 1
/ to insert line, use <hr> in your html, then set a width and thickness in CSS
/ margin is the outside, padding is the inside; both referring to space

[WEEK 2]
/ PNG = portable network graphic
/ GIF = set of images with a timer, displaying movement
/ JPEG should be used for a huge background image; PNGs otherwise
/ PNG and GIFs can be both transparent but use PNGs because they're easier
/ 960px is a good max-width default number for laptops, maybe not desktops
/ Import fonts to CSS
/ Source Sans Pro = good font.
/ Four types of position: STATIC is the default
/// Absolute means it will ALWAYS be there no matter what, removes it in context of anything else
/// Fixed will stay there as we scroll ??
/// Relative will be relative to the thing ABOVE it.

[BRAINSTORM: FINAL PROJECT]
/ Personal resume showcasing personal projects (could be one page with links up top sourcing to different sections within the page instead of outsourcing to new pages)
/// Main landing page with contact information
/// About Me, Fun Facts, etc.
/// Education & Experience, Skills
/// Projects (maybe a link outsourcing to other individual smaller websites)

/ Family webpage connecting family across the globe (would have to be able to utilize different languages, maybe include a language swap button at the top?)
/// Main landing page with basic information about what the website is on top half, clickable sections for countries on the bottom half (think Smash Bros website)
///// Within those landing pages, could do like states or cities, providences, etc.
/////// Within those landing pages for subareas, could include information about who lives where and how to connect with them, etc. via email, social media etc.; also gallery of recent pictures with captions
